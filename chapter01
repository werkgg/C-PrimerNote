//Chapter 1
//In C++ an expression yields a result and is composed of one or more operands and (usually) an operator.
//The << operator takes two operands: The left-hand operand must be an ostream object; the right-hand operand is a value to print. 
//"endl" is a special value called a manipulator. Writing "endl" has the effect of ending the current line and flush the buffer associated with that device.

std::endl;
//the prefix std:: indicates that the names "endl" is defined inside the namespace named std.
//All the names defined by the standard library are in the std namespace.
//Writing std::cout uses the scope operator (the :: operator) to say that we want to use the name cout that is defined in the namespace std.

//When we initialize a variable, we give it the indicated value at the same time as the variable is created.

//end-of-file: ctrl-d

//the "." dot operator applies only to objects of class type. The left-hand operand must be an object of class type, and the right-hand operand must name a member of that ty pe. The result of the dot operator is the member named by the right-hand operand.
